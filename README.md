## Requirements
MolSets requires the following packages:
- PyTorch >= 2.0
- PyG (`torch_geometric`)
- PyTorch Scatter (only for [DMPNN](https://github.com/itakigawa/pyg_chemprop))

The environment can be set up by running
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
But there may be package compatibility issues that need manual corrections. To run on GPUs, CUDA and GPU-enabled versions of PyTorch and PyG are requried.
